Welcome to the course! We're back in person, and we're all going to be getting used to in-person classes again.

We will be using regularly scheduled class time for live discussions of the slides, videos, coding activities, and / or readings that have been posted for the day. 

* Please review the slides and videos (if applicable) before class
* Please attend the live lectures, code along, and ask questions
* All live lectures will be recorded
