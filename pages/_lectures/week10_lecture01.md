This lecture will be a continuation of [Lecture 24](week09-lecture03). We're going to do a few more dictionary practice problems.

## Please complete the following challenges:
1. Write a program that counts the number of trees in each condition (good, fair, etc.).
2. Write a program that counts the number of trees belonging to each species.
3. Write a program to make a map of all the trees in Evanston by installing and using using the `folium` module.
