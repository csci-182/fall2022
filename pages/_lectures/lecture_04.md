<img class="module-image" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/lectures/lecture04-css.png" /> Today we are going to go over some of the core rules of CSS and do a practice activity (see below).  Whereas you can kind of wing it with HTML tags and look them up as needed, having a sense of how CSS works is essential to making professional-looking websites. When you have completed this lesson, you should be familiar with selectors, how to specify color values, some font properties, and the "box model."
