If you have already taken Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 and are satisfied with your grade, Quiz 3 is optional (given that you can drop your lowest quiz score).

## PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
* Quiz 3 will be administered online using the Lockdown Browser
* It will take place **during regularly scheduled class time (10-10:50AM)** on Friday, December 3rd.
* You may take the quiz in Lutkin Hall (Sarah will be there) or at home. Either is fine -- totally up to you.
* If you are registered with ANU and have been given extended time, I will reach out to you separately.
