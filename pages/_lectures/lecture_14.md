<img class="module-image" src="/fall2022/assets/images/lectures/loops.gif" /> In this lesson, weâ€™re going to go over while loops and for loops -- ways of allowing your program to repeat code for a specified number of iterations. Being able to repeat code blocks (also know as "looping" or "iterating") is very powerful, and will allow you to easily perform repetitive tasks in a variety of different contexts: playing songs, drawing pictures, building animations, doing data processing, and so forth. Please do the assigned readings -- they will help you get a solid foundation of JavaScript loops.
