In this lesson, we are going to take a look at two new data types -- lists and tuples -- which are in the "sequence" family. These data structures allow us to group collections of data together conveniently.

> ## Note: References Have Changed Slightly
> In the pre-recorded video, some of the slides / file references have changed from last quarter, but the content is the same.

During lecture, we will be going through several different examples of how you might want to use a list / tuple.

<!-- TODO: add a few slides that go over some of the key functions of a tuple -->
