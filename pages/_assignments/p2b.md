## Overview
Your submission for this week’s deliverable should consist of two parts:

1. Sharing some design / code of what you have accomplished (Q1).
2. Answering the 4 reflective questions below (Q2-Q5).

This is an opportunity for you to reflect on your accomplishments, and consider how you can best use the remaining time that you have to come to a reasonable stopping point for your project.

## 1. Code & Designs [6pts]
Please share something that best represents your progress thus far. This could be a link to your your GitHub repository, a screenshot of your code (or some attachments), drawings of your screens, a Figma mockup, etc.

> ### Side note
> We’re all still learning how all of these technologies work, so no need to feel hesitant to share your progress…even if you hoped to be further along! The point is to put in a good faith effort and to get some feedback.
