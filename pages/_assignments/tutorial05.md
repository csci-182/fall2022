Today will be our last day of formal HTML & CSS instruction, though you will still be using both HTML and CSS for the duration of the course. Specifically, we will explore a few ways of enhancing your visual design using some additional HTML5 language features (audio, video, geolocation) and CSS properties (background effects, pseudoclasses, transitions, and keyframes).

After discussing some of these options as a class, you will pick a technique to try on your own, just to get a taste of something you might want to pursue in greater detail for your final project. More information will be posted soon!
