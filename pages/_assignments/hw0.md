## Tutorial Sign-Ups
As described in the syllabus, this course involves weekly small-group tutorial sessions where you will will work in groups of ~12 students and a member of the teaching staff. Tutorials beginning in Week 2 (starting on 9/27). Tutorial sessions will be run synchronously (live) by your assigned peer mentors. During each tutorial session, you will work through an exercise together with your peer mentor, to advance your understanding of targeted programming concepts. Tutorial submissions count for 10% of your grade.

Please sign-up for a tutorial using <a class="lab" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9io9LSvSR_IolYRnwMluJ2Eq_qFN7uhGFRBMQVzvec/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">THIS SIGN-UP SHEET <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>. This spreadsheet will be made editable during lecture on Friday (9/24).

> * There should be roughly 12 students per tutorial (give or take). 
> * **Do not delete someone else’s name** if they have already signed up for a slot. There will be space for everyone, but we may just have to shift some things around if there are no times that fit with your schedule.
> * Some tutorial sessions take place virtually. Others take place in person. Make sure you check the "Location" column before you sign up (if you have a preference for one over the other).
