## Introduction
The goal of today's lab is to YYYYY.

{:.compact}
1. [Create a fixed navigation bar](#part1)
1. [Style your card](#part2)
1. [Arrange your cards](#part3) (for desktop, mobile, and tablet)


## Your Tasks

Using any approach you want, create the following screens for desktop, tablet, and mobile (pictured below). To do this:

1. Open the `lab01/exercise02` folder.
1. You will need to use media queries, which have been set up for you in the `exercise02/style.css` file.
    * Hint: [media queries reference](/fall2022/css-reference/media-queries/)
1. You will also need to uncomment the viewport meta tag in the `<head></head>` section of your HTML file.
    * Read more about the viewport meta tag on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag" target="_blank">MDN</a>. In the context of mobile web design, this tag tells the browser to honor the dimensions of the device (versus assuming that the website was designed for a desktop screen).

### Mobile

### Jazz it Up
If you have time, please experiment with one or more of the following enhancements:
1. Try changing the font of the Card header (H2 tag) to use a Google Font.
    * Hint: Give <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-your-next-web-design-project-e1ad48f1adfa/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> a shot (or find one you like better)
1. Change out one of the images for an embedded video (from YouTube of Vimeo).
    * Hint: [Embedding media](/fall2022/html-reference/media-tags/)
1. Try modifying your HTML and CSS files however you want.
