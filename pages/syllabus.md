## About the Course
CSCI XXX is an introduction to computer programming using Python, and assumes no prior programming knowledge. The intent of the course is twofold. First, we want to give you a sense of the kinds of problem-solving and creative pursuits that programming can support. Programming can be many different things — a representational medium, a tool for thinking about problems, a way of amplifying and/or communicating ideas, a means of performing complex calculations over massive datasets, and so forth. Most people who write computer programs are not computer scientists, but rather people who occupy a range of professions (journalists, geographers, sociologists, scientists, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, researchers, etc.), and who use various programming languages to accomplish diverse and specialized goals. Moreover, as data and computing increasingly mediate modern life, knowing a bit about the mechanisms (and risks!) that underlie these systems is a valuable modern literacy that is likely to serve you well.

A second goal of the course is to introduce you to the fundamental constructs of computer programming, and some skills and strategies for helping you apply these low-level constructs in creative and useful ways. Towards this end, there will be quite a few drills and practice problems to get you familiar with ‘the basics.’ You need to dedicate enough time to practicing the basics: the fun, creative parts of programming are only possible when you understand the building blocks; and understanding comes from an active, consistent, and iterative engagement with new ideas. Taking this course means committing — for 10 weeks — to attending lectures and office hours, turning in assignments / projects, doing (lots of) practice problems, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult and asking questions. We have an excellent staff of teaching assistants and peer mentors who are here just for you and your questions and ideas. With your consistent and active participation in your own learning, we can guide you through the material so that you can become a proficient programmer. Welcome to the course!

## Course Format

### Lectures
Lectures will be both synchronous and asynchronous. We will use our scheduled class time to do practice problems together and make sure your questions get answered. All in-class lectures will be recorded. You will also be assigned some pre-recorded videos, which cover specific concepts and ideas that we will be practicing during lecture. Organizationally, some topics/modules span multiple lectures (see the [course schedule](../)). 

**Bottom line**: We want you to attend the in-person lectures. That said, all lectures will be recorded and posted to the website, and therefore it is possible to successfully complete this course without ever attending a "live" lecture.

### Tutorial Sessions (Your Participation Grade)
The best way to learn how to program is to practice writing lots of programs. To encourage this, you will sign up for a required tutorial section on on Friday, 9/21. There will be around 17 tutorial sections that you can sign up for (with around 12 students per section). Your tutorial peer mentor will be your "go to person" for the course -- feel free to reach out to them with any questions or concerns that you may have.

These tutorials have a few goals:
1. To help you become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to approach problems (which will be closely related to the homework / projects).
1. To force you to write lots of programs (practice makes perfect!)
1. To help you to assess what you know and don't know, so that you can make a plan to attend office hours.

Tutorials will be graded pass/fail. Even if you don't get everything working perfectly, you will still get full credit if you demonstrate a good-faith effort. You must submit **at least 7 tutorials**, but are encouraged to complete them all.

### Installing Software
As this is a programming course, you will be using some free software programs and libraries in order to write Python programs. Installing and configuring this software can be a huge hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your working computing knowledge. 

> If you are struggling to get Python and your code editor installed, this is (alas) ***normal*** (ask any software engineer). This is also one of the reasons why we have such a big course staff: to troubleshoot individual laptop problems with students.

## Getting Questions Answered

### Office Hours
Office hours (and tutorials) are hands down **THE BEST** resource this course has to offer. That said, it's up to you to take initiave and cultivate a weekly / bi-weekly office-hours-going practice that works for you and your schedule. This looks different for everyone: some people go to 1-2 office hours sessions per week and finish their homework with a TA or peer mentor nearby (if needed). Other students never go to office hours (though this is rare, as the homeworks and projects are challenging). Also, different people connect with different TAs/peer mentors, so do shop around to find a person with whom you work well...and drop in sooner rather than later! 

The kinds of questions that are perfectly legitimate to ask in office hours include (but are not limited to):

* I don't know where to start in this week's homework. Can you help?
* My laptop won't run the code! Help!
* My code's not working? What's my error?
* I didn't understand X idea in lecture / tutorial this week. Can you explain it to me?
* What courses should I take next after CS110?
* What kinds of CS-related careers and opportunities are out there?


### Grading Questions
For grading questions/concerns, or for any other issues, please come talk to me. This might include things like concerns about your progress in the course, questions about content from my lectures, personal matter related to your participation in the course, larger grade concerns, advice about future courses, majors and internships, etc.

## Office Hours
Office hours and locations / Zoom links are posted <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/times-locations/">here</a>. Some office hours will be in person. Others will be virtual. See the course calendar for details.

## Grading
Your course grade is calculated based on 200 points as follows:

{:.medium}
| **2 Projects** | 2 x 40 Points | 80 Points | 40% |
| **2 Quizzes** (of 3) | 2 x 30 Points (lowest score dropped) | 60 Points | 30% |
| **5 Homeworks** (of 6) | 5 x 8 Points (lowest score dropped) | 40 Points | 20% |
| **7 Tutorials** (of 9) | 7 x ~3 Points (lowest scores dropped) | 20 Points | 10% |
| | | **200 Points** | **100%** |

Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is 
an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

1. Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
1. We will not be using the final exam time for this class.

> ### NOTE: Leniency is built into the course
> Because there are unprecedented and uncertain times, I have built leniency into the design of the class. You will be able to:
> * drop your lowest quiz score (best 2 of 3)
> * drop your lowest homework score (best 5 of 6)
> * Keep your best 7 tutorial scores (best 7 of 9)
>
> I have done this to make the class equitable. Use this leniency wisely. In other words, skipping HW1, Quiz1, and Tutorial1-2 is an ill-advised approach. **I will not grant additional exceptions unless the circumstances are truly exceptional, and this will need to go through the Dean of Students (or some similar NU entity).**


### Homework Grading
Homework will be approximately weekly, and is due at 11:59pm on the specified date.

We will still accept late homework up to 48 hours after the original due date, but with a 2 point penalty (25%). Homework is graded on the following scale:

|--|--|
| **No submission / little understanding** | 0 Points | Little to no understanding/effort demonstrated |
| **Check minus** | 3 Points | Some effort made, but significant features are missing or not working |
| **Check** | 6 Points | Mostly working, but some errors or issues were found |
| **Check Plus**| 8 Points | Working exactly as it should |

On occasion, the grader may make an error. You will receive your assignment grades on Canvas. If you have any grading questions/concerns, please send a private message on Campuswire within 1 week to the graduate TA to resolve the issue. Finally, it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date on class material and announcements, as the schedule is subject to change. This includes material presented and announcements made in class, via email, or on Campuswire.

## Policy on Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

* Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
* Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous CSCI XXX students.
* While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
* Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by UNCA’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in UNCA’s Student Conduct Code.
